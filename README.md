# Nettle Back End

The back end for Nettle has several tables (trip, item, user).  The ERD is setup
so a users and trips have a many to many relationship.  And each trip has many
items. This is in the infantile stage of the project, in the future there
will be another table called user's list where it would have many items and
belong to both a user and a trip.
